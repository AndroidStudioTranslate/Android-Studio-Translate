  This inspection points out the cases when a variable value 
is never used after its assignment, e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;- a variable is never read after the assignment<br>
&nbsp;- the value is overwritten by another assignment before the variable is next read<br>
&nbsp;- a variable initializer is redundant (for one of the above two reasons)<br>
&nbsp;- a variable is never used.
