  This inspection reports the cases when an expression of pointer type A is used in the context of another pointer type B (assigned, casted, used in a parameter, returned from a
  method, function or a block, etc.). You must explicitly cast one pointer type to another to avoid compiler warnings.
  This inspection isn't applicable when both types are pointers to a class type.
