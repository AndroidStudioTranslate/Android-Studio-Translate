This inspection runs the Clang compiler and collects the issues reported by it. It is used by editor highlighting and in batch mode.
This inspection requires your project to be configured to use Apple LLVM Compiler 4.x or later.
Turn it off to accelerate the batch analysis or remove the Clang highlightings from the editor.
