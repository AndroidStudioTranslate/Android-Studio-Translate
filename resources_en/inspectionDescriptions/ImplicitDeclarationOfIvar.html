  This inspection reports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C#Non-fragile_instance_variables">&quot;non-fragile&quot; instance variables</a>,
  the instance variables that provide backing for the properties to be synthesized at runtime without declaring them in the class' interface.
  Although this is a correct way to declare instance variables, you may have forgotten to declare them explicitly. Because the non-fragile
  instance variables are implemented using an extra layer of indirection, this may lead to undesirable runtime overhead.
